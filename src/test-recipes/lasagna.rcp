instructions:

    using(28-ounce can):
        Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating. 
            yield: boiled water
    
    with(extra virgin olive oil, ground beef chuck) using(large skillet):
        In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

        Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat. 

        yield:
            cooked beef


    with(large bell pepper diced, medium onion diced, cloves garlic minced, cooked beef) using(large skillet):
        Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).

        Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.

        Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes. 
        yield:
            beef mixture

    with(beef mixture, tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, tablespoon Italian seasoning, garlic powder,red/white wine vinegar, sugar) using(14-ounce can):
        Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.

        Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.

        Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)

        Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.

        Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.

        Remove from heat. 
        yield:
            lasagna stuffing

    with(boiled water, salt, dry lasagna noodles) using(28-ounce can):
        By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note noodles may be cooked in advance.)

        Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.

        When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.

        Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil. This will prevent them from sticking together. 
        yield:
            lasagna noodles
