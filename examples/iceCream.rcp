title: Ice cream
description: This silky, luscious and very classic custard can be used as the base 
for any ice cream flavor you can dream up. These particular proportions of milk and 
cream to egg yolk will give you a thick but not sticky ice cream that feels decadent 
but not heavy. For something a little lighter, use more milk and less cream, as long 
as the dairy adds up to 3 cups. You can also cut down on egg yolks for a thinner base, 
but donâ€™t go below three.
